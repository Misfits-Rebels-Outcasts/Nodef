# How to remove a color from your Photo?

Color keying, or chroma keying, is a technique that removes a specific color or color range from a photo. This technique is used to replace a background with another in compositing. Nodef uses a Color Cube to provide capabilities to remove colors from your Photo.

1. Launch the Node Pipeline screen and add a Remove Color With Color Cube node. This node uses a three-dimensional color table to remove colors from the source image pixels. Closeness refers to the range of colors from the base color to use for removing colors. Try changing the Color and Closeness to remove different colors in the Photo.
