# Nodef - Node based Compositing on Mobile 
 
### Propose Ideas
 
This repo proposes the following ideas as the basis for node-based compositing on a mobile device. It is by no means a complete consideration but with the hope of throwing out some ideas for discussion and getting feedback.

Background

[Node-based Compositing on Mobile](NodeBasedCompositingOnMobile.md)

Ideas

* [Node Pipeline for Node Graph](NodePipeline.md)
* Auto Chaining & Reverse Compositing
* Viewer Cycling
* Direct Acyclic Graph Generation

### Open-Source Project

An open source node-based photo filters and effects compositor is created to test the ideas above.

### Nodef - Photo Filters & Effects 

A node-based image filter compositor with a collection of over 150+ filters and effects. It uses the Node Pipeline editor to enable a productive, flexible, and complete node graph compositing experience on a mobile device.
