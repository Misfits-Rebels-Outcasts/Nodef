# Nodef - Node based Compositing on Mobile 
 
### Propose Ideas
 
This repo proposes the following ideas as the basis for node-based compositing on a mobile device. It is by no means a complete consideration but with the hope of throwing out some ideas for discussion and getting feedback.

Background

[Node-based Compositing on Mobile](NodeBasedCompositingOnMobile.md)

Ideas

* [Node Pipeline](NodePipeline.md) for representing Node Graph
* [Auto Chaining](AutoChaining.md) & [Reverse Compositing](ReverseCompositing.md)
* [Viewer Cycling](ViewerCycling.md)
* [Direct Acyclic Graph Generation/Import](DirectedAcyclicGraphGeneration.md)

### Feedback
 
Whether a Node Pipeline is suited for representing a node graph on a small screen requires testing, usage and feedback. If your daily work involves working in a related field, we would appreciate if you could provide feedback to us in this Github repo. This repo also hosts an open-source project that implements the Node Pipeline. An app for the project is also available in Apple App Store.

### Open User Interface

The ideas and user interface proposed here are from some of my random thoughts and not protected by any patents nor IP, or at least as far as I know. Please feel free to use them in any way you deem fit (but of course at your own risk), both commercially and non-commercially.

### Open-Source Project (GPL)

An open source node-based photo filters and effects compositor is created to test the ideas above.

### Nodef - Photo Filters & Effects 

A node-based image filter compositor with a collection of over 150+ filters and effects. It uses the Node Pipeline editor to enable a productive, flexible, and complete node graph compositing experience on a mobile device.
