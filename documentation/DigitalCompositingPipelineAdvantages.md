* Every photo operation, post-processing, image filters, or effects starts with  a node. The rest is build on top of others.
* For example, if you need to perform a Photo Curve on your photo, you add a Photo Curve node to the Pipeline. This enables you to lighten your photo, reduce contrast, or increase the shadows of your photo.
* After applying a Photo Curve, if you need to enhance the Depth of Field, you simply add the Depth of Field node.
* When you add a node, you can build upon any of the previous steps. Not just the previous step. You can also reorder your operations or add/remove any of the steps.
* You can also mix any of the previous steps with a Blend node. You can choose from Subtract Blend, Mix, Multiplication Blend, or many others.
* You can even expand to 3D or Augmented Reality by adding a Model Entity node and reference a texture or video from any of the previous steps.
* A programmer can easily join the pipeline by adding a node to the Pipeline.
