### Epilogue
Once upon a day, or every single day, I came to myself within a dark wood. How hard it is to tell others what it was like, this wood of wilderness. I woke to wander off, to surf, and to slay it. But in the middle of my journey, I chance upon a wave of compositing. With the song of my humble abode, the after effects of the storm, and the plural blend of my foundry substance, O' how I wished I could, my beloved Dido, to ride the pipeline, not on my board, but on my olo. Art thou that Virgil, I kept thinking, that will guide me out of this dark wood. With all the reverse references, a different course from this must thou pursue. I apologize if you are reading all this, the good ideas, I chance upon the wood, all the silly ones are mine. I would only be in your way but every single day I will think of you each node of the way. I wish you health, all the good life, and most importantly, a safe return from your journey after all this, but deep in my heart, I know it ain't not going to be the way. j'upi.ter 19-August-2022
