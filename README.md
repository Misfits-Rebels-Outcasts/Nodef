# Digital Compositing on Mobile 
 
Nodef - No definition or node definition.

### Proposed Ideas
 
This repo proposes the following ideas as the basis for digital (node-based) compositing on a mobile device. It is by no means a complete consideration but with the hope of ideation and feedback.

Background
