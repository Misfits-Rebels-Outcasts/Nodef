The overall effect is similar to what you would achieve by shining a diffuse spotlight on the source image. If the source image sample color is lighter than 50% gray, the background is lightened, similar to dodging. If the source image sample color is darker than 50% gray, the background is darkened, similar to burning. If the source image sample color is equal to 50% gray, the background is not changed. Image samples that are equal to pure black or pure white produce darker or lighter areas, but do not result in pure black or white."
