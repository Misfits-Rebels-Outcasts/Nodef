# How to make your Photo rush in from the right? 

This effect can be produced by combining the Row Average of an image with a Swipe Transition.

1. Launch the Node Pipeline and add a Row Average filter node. Row Average returns an image that contains the average color for each scan row.

2. Use the 'ADD COMPOSITE FILTER NODE' to add a Swipe Transition. A Swipe Transition transitions from one image to another by simulating a swiping action. You can change the Angle, Color, or Width of the swipe in its node properties. You can also specify the amount of 'rushed in' by changing the Time property.
